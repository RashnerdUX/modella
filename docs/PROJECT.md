# Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a fashion stylist web application that uses AI to analyze wardrobe photos and offer outfit suggestions, styling tips, and product links.

## Architecture

**Backend:** Django REST API with cookie-based JWT authentication
- RESTful API endpoints for wardrobe, outfits, and recommendations
- Custom cookie-based JWT authentication system for security
- Celery + Redis for background AI processing tasks
- PostgreSQL database with S3 media storage

**Frontend:** React SPA with modern tooling
- React Router v7 for client-side routing
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- Cookie-based authentication flow with automatic refresh
- Protected routes and centralized auth context

##  Gemini Features Utilized
- **Image Understanding:** Analyze uploaded clothing items (type, color, pattern, style).
- **Text Generation:** Provide outfit descriptions, style advice, and occasion-based suggestions.
- **Image Generation:** (Future) Create AI-generated visuals of outfits.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Platform (Current)
**Status: âœ… Complete**
- Wardrobe upload and text-based outfit suggestions
- Django REST API with cookie-based JWT authentication
- React SPA with modern tooling and protected routes
- AI-powered recommendations via Gemini
- Railway deployment capability

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features & Scalability
**Target: Q1-Q2 2025**
- Body type analysis and style preferences
- Advanced outfit algorithms with personal data
- E-commerce integration and gap detection
- Performance optimization and caching
- **Deployment Options:**
  - Maintain monolithic Railway deployment OR
  - Separate frontend (Vercel/Netlify) + backend (Railway)
  - Multi-region CDN for global performance

### Phase 3: Advanced AI & Community
**Target: Q3-Q4 2025**
- AI-generated outfit visuals on models
- Mass wardrobe photo analysis and auto-tagging
- Community features: sharing, challenges, trends
- Mobile app development (React Native potential)
- **Deployment Evolution:**
  - Microservices architecture consideration
  - Separate AI processing service
  - Content delivery network for generated images
  - Mobile backend-as-a-service integration

## Development Strategy Considerations

### Architecture Evolution
- **Current:** Monolithic Django + React SPA
- **Near-term:** Separated frontend/backend for independent scaling
- **Long-term:** Microservices with dedicated AI, user, and content services

### Deployment Flexibility
- **Development:** Local Django + React dev servers
- **Staging:** Preview deployments on Vercel/Netlify + Railway staging
- **Production:** Choose based on scaling needs:
  - Cost-effective: Railway monolithic
  - Performance: Vercel/Netlify frontend + Railway backend
  - Enterprise: Multi-service cloud architecture

### Technology Migration Paths
- **Database:** Start PostgreSQL, consider read replicas for scaling
- **Frontend:** React SPA foundation allows PWA or mobile app extension
- **AI Processing:** Current Gemini integration allows future model swapping
- **Authentication:** Cookie-based JWT supports mobile and web clients

### Team Structure Impact
- **Full-stack developer:** Railway monolithic deployment
- **Frontend specialist:** Vercel/Netlify with backend API integration
- **DevOps focus:** Multi-service Railway or cloud provider setup
- **AI/ML specialist:** Separate processing services and model optimization
